Example: Fix field $\FF$

For $n\geq0$ let $P_n(F) = \\{a_0 + a_1x +a_2x^2\\}$

the set of formal polynomials with coefficients from $\FF$
of degree $\leq n$ (or no degree)
0 has no degree
non-zero constant poly's have degree 0

Define = and scalar mul (by $\FF$)
on $P_n(\FF)$ in obvious ways.

Claim: $P_n(\FF)$ is a vector space over $\FF$

Example:
$$\FF[x] = \bigcup_{n\geq 0} P_n(\FF)$$

Claim: $\FF[x]$ is a vector space over $\FF$
(Note: called $P_n(\FF)$ in text.)

Derive facts about all vector spaces.

Theorem: Spas V is vector space If $x,y,z \in V$ and $x+z = y+z$ then $x=y$ (Cancellation Theorem)

Proof:(Use the def)
Assume $ x,y,z \in V$ and $x+y = y+z$

Let $0 \in V$ be the vector satisfying (VS 3)(VS 4)
Using (VS 4), there exist $u\in V$ with $z+u= 0$
So
$$
\begin{align*}
x &= x+0\text{ by (VS 3)}\\\\
&= x +(z+u)\text{ by choice of u via (VS 4) }\\\\
&= (x+z)+u\text{ by (VS 2) }\\\\
&=(y+z)+u \text{ by assumption }\\\\
&=y+(z+u) \text{ by (VS 2) }\\\\
&=y+0\text{  by choice of u }\\\\
&=y \text{ by (VS 3) }\\\\
\end{align*}
$$

Corollary: In a vector space, there is only one zero vector
Proof Assume $O_1$ and $O_2$ both satisfy (VS 3),(VS 4)
Then $x+O_1 = x$ for all $x\in V$
and $x+O_2 = x$ for all $x\in V$

So

$$
\begin{align*}
O_1 +x &= x+O_1 \\\\
& = x \\\\
& = x+O_2 \\\\
&= O_2 +x \\\\
\end{align*}
$$
By Cancellation Thm, $O_1 = O_2$
This proves there is only one zero vector

Corollary: Let V be a vector space and $x\in V$ There is only one $u\in V$ satisfying $x+u=0$
Proof: Assume $x+u_1 = x+u_2 = 0$
Then $u_1 = u_2$ by Cancellation and (VS 1)

Def: Let V be a vector space, $x,y\in V$

 1. -x means the unique $u \in V$
satisfying $x+u = 0$
 2. $x-y$ means $x+(-y)$

Theorem. Space B is a vector space over $\FF$, $x \in V, a\in \FF$

 1. $0x = 0$
 2. $(-a)x = -(ax) = a(-x)$
 3. $a0= 0$

Proof of (1):
Won't show that Ox is a zero vector
(in sense of VS 3 and VS 4)
Then it will show that Ox is the (unique) zero vector

Instead, show

$$
\begin{align*}
0x + 0x &= (0 + 0)x \\\\
&=0x\\\\
&=0x+0\\\\
\end{align*}
$$
Now we use cancellation


Note: by (VS2)	 we can write $$x_1+x_2+...+x_n$$

without puttting in parentheses

And can prove, e.g.
$b(a_1x_1+a_2x_2+...+a_nx_n)$
By induction on n


From now on, I won't worry about low-level things.

Def. Let V be a vector space over $\FF$ let $x, u_1,...,u_n \in V$
We say x is a linear combination of $u_1,...u_n$
if there exist scalars $a1,....,an \in \FF$ satisfying
$x = a_1x_1+a_2x_2+...+a_nx_n$

Basic Problem: Deciding whether x is a linear combination of $u_1,...u_n$

Example:$V = P_4(\RR)$

$$
\begin{align*}
v &= 4x^4 + 7x^2 - 2x +3 \\\\
\end{align*}
$$
